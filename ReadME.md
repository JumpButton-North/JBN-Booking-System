### JumpButton North - Booking System
---
The JumpButton North Booking System is a Node.JS package that is being developed for easy use on any Node.JS website/app. The Calendar itself is client-side generated with customizable colour schemes. It's very easy to implement as well.


##### Example
``` html

<div class="container">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-md-8 pt-5">
			<div id="jbn_booking"></div>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/booking/jbnbook.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
JBNBookingSystem({
	container: "#jbn_booking",
	primary_color: "#2859B7" // Optionally Change The Colour Scheme.
});
</script>
```
