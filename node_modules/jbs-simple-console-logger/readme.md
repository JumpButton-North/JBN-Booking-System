I was writing a node project and realized that the console only had 2 types of outputs. Log and Error. So I took it upon myself to write a logger module that has multiple outputs: *TRACE,DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR*

---
Usage
---
Below are a few code examples with their outputs.

``` javascript
var logger = require("jbs-simple-console-logger");
var obj = {name: "Test",value:1};
logger.info("Object",obj);
```

``` javascript
var logger = require("jbs-simple-console-logger");
logger.trace("logger","Logger is ready");
logger.debug("logger","Logger is ready");
logger.info("logger","Logger is ready");
logger.warn("logger","Logger is ready");
logger.error("logger","Logger is ready");
```

The above code generates this output:

var logger = require("jbs-simple-console-logger");
logger.setMode(logger.modes.INFO);
logger.trace("logger","Logger is ready");
logger.debug("logger","Logger is ready");
logger.info("logger","Logger is ready");
logger.warn("logger","Logger is ready");
logger.error("logger","Logger is ready");
```
